Title: Setting up new Khepera

- Opened two new Kheperas yesterday; put labels on them saying 192.168.0.111 and 192.168.0.112. Need to set them up
- Connect to 192.168.0.111 via USB; use minicom -s to establish communication
- Setting up to connect to WiFi:
    - For reference: 
        - Default wifi.network: 
            # Automatically bring-up default wifi interface as a wireless client.
            # If possible, get an address using DHCP. This works in tandem with
            # wpa_supplicant to establish a network connection.
            # See http://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.network.html
            [Match]
            Name=wlan0

            [Network]
            #DHCP=v4
            DNS=172.16.156.1
            Address=172.16.156.56/24
            Gateway=172.16.156.1
        - Default wpa_supplicant-wlan0.conf:
            # Adjust this file for your network.  See [1] for
            # more details.
            # [1] http://linux.die.net/man/5/wpa_supplicant.conf
            ctrl_interface=/var/run/wpa_supplicant
            ctrl_interface_group=0
            update_config=1

            # Connect to any open network
            network={
                ssid="korebot"
                key_mgmt=NONE
            }


            #network={
            ##      ssid="add-your-ascii-ssid"
            ##      proto=WPA2
            ##      key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
            ##      pairwise=CCMP TKIP
            ##      group=CCMP TKIP
            ##      scan_ssid=1
            ##      psk="add-your-ascii-passphrase"
            ##      priority=10
    - Get MAC address using ifconfig, called Hwaddr
    - Register to CMU-DEVICE: https://www.cmu.edu/computing/services/endpoint/network-access/wireless/how-to/cmudevice.html
    - Update wifi.network with ip given by CMU-DEVICE:
        [Match]
        Name=wlan0

        [Network]
        DHCP=v4
        Address=172.26.166.38/24
        Gateway=172.26.166.1
    - Update wpa_supplicant-wlan0.conf for CMU-DEVICE:
        ctrl_interface=/var/run/wpa_supplicant
        ctrl_interface_group=0
        update_config=1

        network={
                ssid="CMU-DEVICE"
                key_mgmt=NONE
        }
    - Do reboot; see if you can ping back and forth
    - Can ping. Still can't SSH though :(
    - Tried: sshd -p; looks like sshd is isntalled
