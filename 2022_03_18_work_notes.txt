Title: Multi-localization implementation 2

- Need to fix odom_node.hpp and odom_node.cpp to remove coupling discovered yesterday
    - Will turn odom_node into class. This will make each agent contain its own instance of odom_node, avoiding crosstalk
    - Turned odom_node into class. Running test with just agent_bringup, teleop and RVIZ confirmed that system can now differentiate odom from different agents
    - Testing on multiple slam_toolboxes now
    * Got it working! Can localize two agents simultaneously. Need to see how well it works though, and what the CPU load is
- Played with VICON again. Saw that it was jittery and unreliable. Did little digging, and saw it was jittery when near the edges of VICON area
    - Realized issue may be occlusion; have boards set up near edges of VICON area to stop LRF beam, but this also blocks VICON's view of agents near edges of operational area
    - Removed walls and recalibrated VICON; performance seems to be better. Should redo some testing with new setup and see if/how performance changes
    - Discovered new, better way to set world origin. Rather than using magic wand, can use three markers (120 for bigger ones) to set origin, x-axis (primary) and y-axis (secondary)

Title: LRF Adaptor
- On LRF module, LIDAR is almost exactly 2.5 cm off the top of the Khepera
