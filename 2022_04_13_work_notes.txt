Title: Scott Hall Plus Tuning

- Noticed issues when going to office in Scott Hall; need to tune again
- Modifying from tuned parameters from last time (see appendix)
- Attempt 1:
    minimum_travel_distance: 0.25
    link_match_minimum_response_fine: 1.0
    link_scan_maximum_distance: 0.5
    loop_search_space_dimension: 0.5
    distance_variance_penalty: 1.25
    angle_variance_penalty: 1.5
    - Bad LMAO maybe too aggressive
- Played around with it more, but couldn't get much improvement
- Reviewing bag files. 999 seem fine; nothing too alarming. Correction in office near trash is only 25 cm change; hard to tune to fix something that small
- 5:
    - test1: does fine until it gets to big area; office double door being closed may be what's screwing it up
    - test2: localization struggles before reaching big area (14s; partial fix at 34s), though it corrects itself eventually
        - localization not great at starting at 80s, gets worse at 93, gets worse at 110, corrects at 117
