Title: LOCALIZATION

- Trying to get SLAM toolbox to be pure localization
    - Maps are saved here: /home/jsonglaptop/.ros
    - Seems to work if initial pose is fairly accurate
- To generate map: conda deactivate; roslaunch slam_toolbox PR1_teleop.launch 
- To run localization: conda deactivate; roslaunch slam_toolbox robosar_localization.launch
- Localization testing:
    - Rammed agent into wall; localization started to be wrong. After moving agent around in environment for a bit, localization converged to correct pose
    - Placed new obstacles not covered in map in environment; localization was still good
