Title: LIDAR testing

- Got minicom working by:
    1. Granting permission: sudo adduser $USER dialout; then restart computer
    2. Add -D flag to command: minicom -D /dev/ttyACM0
- Connected to LIDAR puck over usb serial, /dev/ttyACM0; 115200 8N1

            - 01: number of scans
        - Received response; not really sure how to interpret it

        - Continuous data stream; can't make sense of it though
- Found ROS guide for LIDAR puck: http://wiki.ros.org/hokuyo_node/Tutorials/UsingTheHokuyoNode
    - Modified permissions for ttyACM0: sudo chmod a+rw /dev/ttyACM0
- Looks like guide wasn't made for noetic. Looked around a bit; found another one: http://wiki.ros.org/urg_node
    - sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-urg-node
    - rosrun urg_node getID /dev/ttyACM0
        - Result: Device at /dev/ttyACM0 has ID H1312832
    - Not much info after that. Found another website: https://sourceforge.net/p/urgnetwork/wiki/ROS_en/
    - rosrun urg_node urg_node _serial_port:=/dev/ttyACM0
        - Connected successfully; streaming data
        - New topics:
            /diagnostics
            /laser_status
            /scan
            /urg_node/parameter_descriptions
            /urg_node/parameter_updates
    - rosrun rviz rviz
        - Change "Global Options->Fixed Frame" to "/laser".
        - Add "LaserScan".
        - Change "LaserScan->Topic" to "/scan".
    - rviz seems to have a hard time picking up an unpowered LIDAR puck, probably due to its small size
    - While running RVIZ with one puck, hooked up another puck and connected to it over minicom
        - minicom -D /dev/ttyACM1
        - Set it to scan constantly: MD0044072501100
        - No noticeable change in RVIZ when puck was set to scan constantly
        - No noticeable change in RVIZ when puck was disconnected, killing power
- LIDAR looks like it generates about 20 kB of data per scan. 10 scans per second gives 200 kB per second. 10 robots gives 2 MB per second
    - Data transmission can be significantly decreased by grouping, or downsampling. So instead of getting, say, 100 readings, only get 10 readings
- Installed scan_tools for laser_scan_matcher: apt-get install ros-noetic-scan-tools
