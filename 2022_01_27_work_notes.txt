Title: LRF testing

- LRF module Notes
    - 0.36 deg resolution, 682 steps = 245.52 deg FOV
    - 100ms/scan
    - 20mm - 4m range, 1mm resolution
        - +/- 30 mm for 20mm~1m
        - +/- 3% for 20mm-4m
    - LIDAR
        - 5 V @ <= 500 mA
    - Software
        - klrf_test: test script
        - int kb_lrf_Init( char *LRF_DeviceName )
            - argument example: "/dev/ttyACM0"
- Manual says LRF module should have battery, but don't see it
- Working on unit 192.168.0.109
- Compared "ls /dev" before and after plugging in Hokuyo URG via USB
    - Newly added devices: serial, ttyACM0
- Unpacking test, 3.3 of LRF manual
    - SCP klrf_test onto Khepera
    - Executing ./klrf_test:
        - lrfinit: successfully detected LIDAR puck on ttyACM0
        - lrfmeasure 0: successfully visualized shape of wall infront of test area
        - Outputted LIDAR readings to two files
    - ls -l in root; looks like files are about 22 kbytes
        -rw-r--r-- 1 root root  22424 Apr 24 01:07 lrf_test_output.txt
        -rw-r--r-- 1 root root  22446 Apr 24 01:11 lrf_test_output_2.txt
- Removed LIDAR puck; installed LRF module
    - lrfinit: successfully detected LRF module on ttyACM0
    - lrfmeasure 0: successfully visualized shape of wall infront of test area
- Out of curiosity plugged in LIDAR puck while LRF module was installed. First device is ttyAMC0, second device is ttyAMC1
- SCP'd klrf_small_ex and ran it. Works fine.
