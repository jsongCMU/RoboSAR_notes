[RoboSAR:Mapper:TryCloseLoop] Loop closure candidate passed coarse response threshold (response = 0.890718)
[RoboSAR:Mapper:TryCloseLoop] Loop closure candidate PASSED fine response threshold; accepted (response = 0.975425)

Notes: bad loop closure happened in featureless hallway. Perfect match. Can't prevent this, so added features; will test again
