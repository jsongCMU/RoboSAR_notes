Title: Tuned Localization Testing
- Run VICON localization test with tuned parameters: conda deactivate; roslaunch slam_toolbox vicon_localization_test_tuned.launch
    - Publish error: rosrun tf tf_echo vicon/k109_lrf/k109_lrf base_link 10
    - Results were bad; around 10 cm RMS
    - Not sure if calibrated properly; at end of run Khepera should have been at origin, but it was off by about 7 cm
    - Noticed VICON is acting kind of flakey; not sure if it's working, or need recal, or if dots got moved. Should redo that
        - Reinstantiated the object. Jitteriness went away, but balls aren't showing up where they're supposed to on GUI; will try again after dinner
        - Recalibrated, then reinstantiated k109_lrf. Looks ok now. Will retry
    - Rerunning test with tuned parameters:
        - Looks good at first blush; 7.86 cm RMS. Running more analysis
        - Analyzed recorded data from bag file; 7.34 cm RMS
    - Rerunning test with default parameters; got around 10 cm RMS again
    - Ran a couple more tests with tuned parameters; they perform worse than baseline. Also, visually, the tuned parameters look worse than default
- I think there's some sort of error with VICON; that is, it's not a very good ground truth. When I tune toolbox to reduce VICON error, the results
  visibly look worse. Additionally, even if ground truth is good, I can't get it to work better than baseline reliably; of the three tests, two were
  worse. I'd say for now 10 cm RMS is good enough; use the baseline/default parameters and roll with it and see if localization needs to be improved
  further down the line. If we do, then the tuning I've been doing can give insight on how we can improve localization in the future.
