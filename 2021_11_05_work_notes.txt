Title: Khepera programming research

- Looking into reprogramming Khepera by reading chapter 5 of manual
    - Will go with light toolchain for now
    - Says I need "lrzsz"; what is that? Says "Communication package"
        - X/Y/ZMODEM impelementation, whatever that means
        - Won't install for now; might need to later
        - NVM I already have it installed lol
    - Khepera uses Gumstix Overo FireSTORM-Y COM by default
        - Guessing this is right FTP: https://ftp.k-team.com/KheperaIV/software/Gumstix%20COM%20Y/
    - Used script to install light toolchain: poky-glibc-i686-khepera4-image-cortexa8hf-vfp-neon-toolchain-1.8.sh
        - Installed to ~/khepera4_development/SDK
        - Script fails; says relocation script fails; /usr/bin/env or something
        - Kind of worked; "arm-poky-linux-gnueabi-gcc --version" returns valid answer
        - sourced using: "source /opt/poky/1.8/environment-setup-cortexa8hf-vfp-neon-poky-linux-gnueabi"
- Look through documentation by opening index.html in doc/html
