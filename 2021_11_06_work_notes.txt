Title: Khepera cross-compiler, programming

- Summary:
    - Got cross-compiler to work
    - Verified new programs can be run on Khepera
    - Verified Khepera can read sensors and output to its terminal
    - K4_Send_Cmd_P3.py can now send commands and receive sensor data from Khepera

- Note: Khepera IP = 192.168.0.109
- Changed wifi to TP-Link_74ED
- /home/jsonglaptop/khepera4_development/libkhepera-2.1/template
    - Copied template
    - Modified prog-template.c to print "Hello world"
    - Ran Make in terminal; got new template file
    - Changed template file name to hw_template
    - Sent new template over SCP: "scp hw_template root@192.168.0.109:/home/root"
- Access Khepera
    - SSH into Khepera: ssh root@192.168.0.109
    - ./hw_template
        * Successfully printed "Hello world!"; cross-compiler works!
- Modify template in WV script
    - uncomment printing of W and V
    - Run Make; generate new template
    - SCP and run script
    - ROS
        - Run roscore, K4_Send_Cmd_P3.py, Central_Algorithm_Template_Without_Vicon_Input.py
    * Khepera successfully prints Input W and Input V repeatedly; can change and reprogram template!
    - Can't CTRL-C out of ./template; strange
    - Re-commented out printing Input W and Input V
- Modified template to print accelerometer data to terminal
    - SCP, run script
    - Run roscore, K4_Send_Cmd_P3.py, Central_Algorithm_Template_Without_Vicon_Input.py
    * Successfully print accelerometer data to terminal!
    - Successfully CTRL-C out this time; stranger
    - Undid changes to template to print accelerometer data
- Try to get all sensor reading over UDP
    - K4_Send_Cmd_P3.py
        - Add serverSock.recv(4096); print received data
    - prog-template.c
        - Uncomment UDPsendSensor; uncomment other code as necessary to run function
    - Python script seems to get stuck on serverSock.recv; will try adding timeout
        - Timeout causes exception; added try/except to keep code from crashing
    - template claims to be sending data over UDP, and K4_Send_Cmd_P3.py claims nothing was received.
    - Tried changing IP address here: "if(inet_pton(AF_INET, "192.168.0.103", &(*servaddr).sin_addr)<=0)"
        - Didn't work.
        - How does Khepera know where to send info to?
    * Updated PORT in prog-template.c to 2109; can get info from Khepera on Python!!!
    - Changed format to make message easier for human to read. Example output from K4_Send_Cmd_P3.py:
        - Note: Data is Time, Accel, Gyro; encoder Position, encoder Speed; Ultrasonic, Infrared
