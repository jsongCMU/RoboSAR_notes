- wait until LED turngs green after turning on Kbot
- Type in last 3 digits of IP address
- WiFi network has to TPlink_74ED (pwd: Jaskaran will send later)
- Successfull connection will spam 'started false\ntc\n'

inside K4_Send_Cmd.py
- host_ip: ip address of host computer (WiFi settings on computer, get IP address)
- serverSock.bind; 2000 is a hacky thing?
- Direct low level control; angular & linear velocity directly (rad/sec, mm/sec)

Neel got callback to work, but no robot movement
timer callback doesn't get called with Neel's fix
Need to review code more thoroughly

Neel will create GitHub workspace, Jaskaran will post code
