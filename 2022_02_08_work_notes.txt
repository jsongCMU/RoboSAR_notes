Title: SLAM_toolbox initial testing

- In slam_toolbox pckg, created slam_test.launch
    - Launch file will call asynch node, URG node, produce static tf for odom-base_footprint and base_footprint-laser. Also calls RVIZ
    - Saw warning complaining about maximum laser range being incorrect; added parm to correct this
- Call launch file: roslaunch slam_toolbox slam_test.launch
    - Noticed map shown in RVIZ is just one LIDAR scan; moving it around doesn't produce any new data
    - Suspect this is due to odom-base_footprint being static. Maybe slam doesn't get new LIDAR readings if the robot isn't moving?
- Created odom_pub pckgs for testing
    - Currently, base_footprint frame moves back and forth along x-axis with respect to odom frame
- Updated launch file to use odom_pub instead of static tf for odom-base_footprint. Launched updated launch file
    - Map now updates with multiple LIDAR readings
    - Results look really bad. This is because odom-base_footprint is spoofed; during testing LIDAR isn't actually moving at all. This mismatch causes map to look really bad; this is expected
- This suggests that once Khepera and server are good to go, then we can feed LIDAR and odom-base_footprint to SLAM toolbox and it should be able to generate map and pose well
