Title: Intial Scan Matcher
- Sequential scan matcher is set up in Mapper.cpp, under Initialize:
m_pSequentialScanMatcher = ScanMatcher::Create(this,
      m_pCorrelationSearchSpaceDimension->GetValue(),
      m_pCorrelationSearchSpaceResolution->GetValue(),
      m_pCorrelationSearchSpaceSmearDeviation->GetValue(),
      rangeThreshold);
      - Initialize is called near start of Process in Mapper.cpp
- Special case of first scan from a sensor is handled in Mapper.cpp, under AddEdges:
kt_double response = m_pMapper->m_pSequentialScanMatcher->MatchScan<LocalizedRangeScanMap>(pScan,
                                                          pSensorManager->GetScans(rCandidateSensorName),
                                                          bestPose, covariance);
