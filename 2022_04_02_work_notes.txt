Title: Real life testing

- Did testing with Kheperas in real world!
    - Did testing in FRC. Khepera gets stuck every other second. Problem turns out to
      be caster wheels; caster wheels are at same height as wheels. If anything, no matter
      how small, gets under the caster wheels, then the wheels are lifted off the ground,
      preventing motion. Really bad design :(
      - Increasing speed of the Kheperas helps this issue somewhat
    - Did testing in Wean hall using agent1 (.108). Mapping was really hard. Realized
      issue was network; on CMU-DEVICE, we keep losing packets, which means we lose
      odom and laser-scan data, which prevents SLAM_TOOLBOX from working properly
    - Set up new WiFi router given to us by Yi Sha; it works well but its range is
      very bad. During testing, lost connectivity to agent when it was about 14
      meters away
- We have mechanical and network issues, then
    - Mechanical: Will ask to open up Khepera and see if we can improve the 
      mechanical design in anyway. Rachel suggested putting on thicker rubber; 
      this will allow caster wheels to get lifted slightly without losing all 
      our traction.
    - Network: get new router with bigger range. Hopefully setting up yet another
      router won't be too hard :(
